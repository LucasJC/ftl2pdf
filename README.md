# ftl2pdf

This is a simple Spring Boot project that shows how to generate a PDF document from an XHTML Freemarker template.
This example sets up a simple header and footer that get repeated on every generated page.

To execute the project just run:
```bash
./gradlew bootRun
```
Or import to an IDE and execute Ftl2pdfApplication#main
